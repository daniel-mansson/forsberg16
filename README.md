# SQUARE OFF  
## Play all the angles.  

After circling around it for ages, finally the Squares said; it's pointless.  
Now they have come from all corners of Flatland to fight in the Euclid. 

The contenders lines up. 
Can you corner your oppnent? Box them in? 
In time we will see who can conquer this plane. 

Square off against your oppenets and play all the angles.
